        <h1>My Education story</h1>
            <P>I was once in Nursery school. I used to love playing in the rain. It was a wonderful experience for me, but it always got me distracted from the academic part.</P>
            <p>Then I got to primary school, and I got a lot more serious. My attention span was about 50 % better than it used to be.</p>

            <h2>The Improvement</h2>
            <p>When I got to secondary school, it was not much of a different story. But I did try to ready but I just din't love it. But I was told that my performnce started improving drastially at the later point of my secondary years</p>

            <h3>The Truth</h3>
            <p>Then came the final revelation, all the stories above is false and I have just been typing random thoughts, thanks for reading if you actually did. Cheers</p>
